# My First Portfolio

This project is a basic HTML website created to practice fundamental HTML skills. The website consists of multiple pages with basic HTML elements, navigation, embedded media, and a consistent structure. This portfolio includes a homepage, a page for embedded tweets, and additional structured content.

## Project Structure

- **Repository:** My_First_Portfolio
- **Directory:** `html_basic`
- **Files:**
  - `base_index.html`: The basic HTML file with the foundational structure.
  - `index.html`: The homepage with text, headings, an image, and links.
  - `tweets.html`: A page displaying an embedded tweet with navigation back to the homepage.


## Validation

The HTML files have been tested and validated using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure compliance with HTML standards.
